# Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes and can be used to install workloads in
a cluster.

## Installation

[Helm Client] is required to install Helm Server â€” [Tiller] into a cluster and
for any further Helm based operations.

For Helm (actually Tiller) to be able doing operations across the cluster
we increase its privileges by using the "cluster-admin" cluster role. For that
we use the [RBAC Tiller Manifest] to create an appropriate service account and
the corresponding role binding:

```
$ kubectl create -f https://gitlab.tpip.net/aalferov/nfv-k8s/raw/master/cluster/components/helm/rbac-tiller.yaml?private_token=$PRIVATE_TOKEN
```

After that we can install Helm in a way to use that service account:

```
helm init --service-account tiller
```
